### State Management Pattern
- Jotai atoms for data fetching and mutations
- Query atoms for data retrieval
- Mutation atoms for write operations
- Derived atoms for computed state

### Component Architecture
- Reusable UI components in `/components/seller/`
- Page components in `/app/seller/`
- Form validation using existing patterns
- Mobile-responsive design

### Route Protection
- Seller-only route guards
- Authentication requirement
- Redirect logic for non-sellers

### File Structure Pattern
```
frontend/src/
├── components/seller/[feature]/ComponentName.tsx
├── app/seller/[page]/page.tsx
└── lib/atoms/sellerAtoms.ts
```
